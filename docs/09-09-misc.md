# Misc future work

## rename dataMapCache
## you can see joining as a transformation, so would be logical to move it into transformation pipeline too

## layered config
see layeredConfig.js in `big_jasper_update` stash branch
better way to separate what user has set and what defaults are, what autoconfig created, etc
you can add many layers of config and it would fallback automatically
normally you'd be writing to the top config
but if it will be equal to soome value below then it would remove it from the top config
that way the user config would be as small as possible
(but scale domain = null overwriting would still remain when we swtich a concept)

## Adapters: dot to join, add explicit and
we can get rid of those by making readers and WS support the query in the form before adapters

##References
Look for `resolveRef`, not every model field has it. Would be better to build it in config, so it behaves consistently.
