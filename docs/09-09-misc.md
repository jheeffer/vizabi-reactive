# Misc future work

## rename dataMapCache
## rename hasEncodingMarker
isOnEncodingLevel?

## Move joinery to trasnformation
you can see joining as a transformation, so would be logical to move it into transformation pipeline too

## layered config
See layeredConfig.js in `big_jasper_update` stash branch. The idea is a better way to separate what user has set and what defaults are, what autoconfig created, etc. You can add many layers of config and it would fallback automatically top layers to bottom. Normally you'd be writing to the top config
but if a value you set will be equal to the value in a layer below then it would remove it from the top config: that way the user config would be as small as possible (but scale domain = null overwriting would still remain when we swtich a concept because we don't want to fall back to the page config, to solve that the domain would have to depend on concept).

## References
Look for `resolveRef`, not every model field has it. Would be better to build it in config, so it behaves consistently. Layered config has that built in

## Adapters: dot to join, add explicit and
we can get rid of those by making readers and WS support the query in the form before adapters


## Proper classes
