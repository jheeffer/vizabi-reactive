Now vizabi-data is build mostly as a pull-based application.

Each computed "pulls" the data it needs in.
Maybe we'd want more that when data comes in, it decides where it goes. The server-side, the push side is in control, rather than the client, the user or pull side.
Very abstract, need to work out if this is an actual thing.

E.g. new data comes in, which then calculates and sets the domain of related scales.
